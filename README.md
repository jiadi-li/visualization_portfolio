This is my public repository for the Telling Stories with Data course at CMU!

# About Me
Hello everyone! 
I'm Jiadi Li, a Master of Information Systems Management student. <br/>
After graduating this December, I'll start working as an associate data product manager. I believe the knowledege and skills I learned in this course and the past one and a half year at CMU will be extremely helpful.

# What I hope to learn
Technology has been developed drastically for the past few years. Any specific technical tools and skills we learn in the program might not be as effective or useful as time goes by. <br/>
However, for this course, I'm expecting to improve my skills such as data visualization, extracting useful information from data, telling stories and etc. which will always be relevant and will never go out of fashion. Moreover, these skills, especially for telling stories and conveying ideas, are critical for my career goals and many aspects of life.<br/>
Even though I should and will never stop learning, the skills I developed in this course will, hopefully, help me along my career and life.

# Portfolio
This section will be updated with the links to my future assignments and final project of this course.
