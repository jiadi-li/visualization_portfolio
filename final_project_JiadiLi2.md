## Final Project Wireframes / Storyboards and User Research 

### Wirefames / storyboard for user feedback

#### Characters
There will be three characters in this story:
- A young man: a college student who is interested in persuing a career in product management. He may know some facts of the role, but is not clear what to do towards the goal.
- Ms. Optimismï¼šShe is good at generating conclusions from the facts, but her analysis is always optimistic.
- Ms. Pessimism: In contrast, her analysis is always pessimisitic.

The reason for creating this three character explicitly is to create a conversational environment. <br/>

#### Structure
The cavas will be divided into three two parts horizontally with a bright color (potentially Red) on the left side for Ms.Optimism's narratives and a darker color (potentially dark blue or dark grey) on the right side for Ms.Pessimism's narratives. <br/>

For each evidence/visualization/graph discussed by the young man, Ms. Optimism and Ms. Pessimism's opinions with be shown on their corresponding side.

#### Visualizations

The young man narrative: "Hello everyone! I'm a college student who is very interested in product management. However, as I look through some market trends, job openings and requirements, I'm a little confused. Can anyone give me some advice on **WHAT SHOULD I DO TO GET A JOB IN PRODUCT MANAGEMENT?**" (highlighted part will have much bigger font in the final product) <br/>

"First, let's take a look at the median salary trends of Product Managers since 2017." <br/>

### Creation of a user research protocol and completion of at least three interviews

User research protocol: <br/>
a. the target audience to reach with your story: <br/>
  college students who are interested in pursuing a career in product management; 
  
b. approach to identifying representative individuals to interview: <br/>
  Based on the target audience definition, the ideal interviewees are undergraduate students, graduate students and professionals/other individuals who are interested in the subject. In this case, representative individuals to interview are mostly from these crowd.
  
c. interview script: <br/>
1. Can you tell me what you think this is?
2. Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
3. Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
4. Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
5. Is there anything you would change or do differently?
6. Did you get any new idea or understanding of the topic from this?
7. Do you have any other related information that you expected to see from this?
8. Do you have any other recommendations?

d. the findings from the interviews:
  1. Don't use abbreviations, spell out the whole word (like Product Manager instead of "PMs")
  2. In all the visualizations, make sure to include dollar sign or other symbols when necessary
  3. 
  4. 
  5. 
  
e. changes the implemented to the sketches, storyboards and wireframes to address the issues identified: please see below.
