## Final Project Wireframes / Storyboards and User Research 

### Wirefames / storyboard for user feedback

#### Characters
There will be three characters in this story:
- A young man: a college student who is interested in persuing a career in product management. He may know some facts of the role, but is not clear what to do towards the goal.
- Ms. Optimismï¼šShe is good at generating conclusions from the facts, but her analysis is always optimistic.
- Ms. Pessimism: In contrast, her analysis is always pessimisitic.

The reason for creating this three character explicitly is to create a conversational environment. <br/>

#### Structure
The cavas will be divided into three two parts horizontally with a bright color (potentially Red) on the left side for Ms.Optimism's narratives and a darker color (potentially dark blue or dark grey) on the right side for Ms.Pessimism's narratives. <br/>

For each evidence/visualization/graph discussed by the young man, Ms. Optimism and Ms. Pessimism's opinions with be shown on their corresponding side.

#### Visualizations

### Creation of a user research protocol and completion of at least three interviews

User research protocol: 
a. the target audience to reach with your story: <br/>
  college students who are interested in pursuing a career in product management; 
  
b. approach to identifying representative individuals to interview: <br/>
  Based on the target audience definition, the ideal interviewees are undergraduate students, graduate students and professionals/other individuals who are interested in the subject. In this case, representative individuals to interview are mostly from these crowd.
  
c. interview script: <br/>
- General questions:
