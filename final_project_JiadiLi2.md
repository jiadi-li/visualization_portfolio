## Final Project Wireframes / Storyboards and User Research 

### Wirefames / storyboard for user feedback

#### Characters
There will be three characters in this story:
- A young man: a college student who is interested in persuing a career in product management. He may know some facts of the role, but is not clear what to do towards the goal.
- Ms. Optimismï¼šShe is good at generating conclusions from the facts, but her analysis is always optimistic.
- Ms. Pessimism: In contrast, her analysis is always pessimisitic.

The reason for creating this three character explicitly is to create a conversational environment. <br/>

#### Structure
The cavas will be divided into three two parts horizontally with a bright color (potentially Red) on the left side for Ms.Optimism's narratives and a darker color (potentially dark blue or dark grey) on the right side for Ms.Pessimism's narratives. <br/>

For each evidence/visualization/graph discussed by the young man, Ms. Optimism and Ms. Pessimism's opinions with be shown on their corresponding side.
