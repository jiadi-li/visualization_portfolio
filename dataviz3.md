##### why this visualization
This data visualization is from a course I took earlier about fintech industry. The data visualization is intended to inform readers about the risk tolerance situation for the past decades. While it has several advantages which makes it a decent product, it also has some crucial disadvantages. These characteristics makes the visualization interested to be discussed and redesigned. 

#### Step 2: critique the data visualization

#### Step 3: wireframe a solution

##### insight from critique method (redesign ideas & next steps)
The advantages of this visualization are: 
1. the visualization provides a descriptive sub-title which tells us the conclusion of the presenter; 
2. it also uses clear labels to support our understanding; 
3. the plot is not overwhelmed with information; 
4. The use of percentage instead of number of people in the survey is persuasive. 

However, there are something I would do differently in my version: 
1. The colors help to distinguish the groups but didn’t add too much value (I will use gradient color scheme); 
2. The data included don’t fully support the subtitle (I will include more data in the graph to draw to the same conclusion); 
3. The type of chart used is fine, but can be changed to some more intuitive types.

##### redesign


#### Step 4: Test the solution


##### insights from user feedback 


##### what's different in the redesign

#### Step 5: Build your solution
