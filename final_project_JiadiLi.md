## Final Project

### Outline

- A high-level summary of your project.  
  This should be a sentence or two that describes what you're interested in showing with your final project.

- A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  
  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe the story arc that you hope to achieve.  
  Talk about the anticipated call to action and outline your user stories. 

### Initial Sketches

- Your sketches should mimic aspects of your outline, and build on the resounding message you want to make clear through your project.  
  Build in elements of your anticipated story structure for your project.
  
### Data

- A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
- A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, 
  or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, 
  Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  
  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first. 
  
### Method & Medium

- In a few paragraphs, you should document how you plan on completing your final project.  
  One option we've already discussed is building a story using your data using Shorthand 
  - but this is my no means your only option.
